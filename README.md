# Sluggo
A modern, simple issue tracker for teams. App for the py4web framework.

# Installation Instructions
Sluggo uses a mostly standard py4web environment as defined by the conda environment for py4web in CSE183, including
the packages added partway through the quarter (click & watchgod).
However, some additional prerequisites are required.

In addition to the standard environment, Sluggo relies on the python-dateutil library. Install this by running:

`conda install python-dateutil`

You should then have all necessary prerequisites to run Sluggo.

## How to Use
You can find thorough documentation on how to use Sluggo in USAGE.md. This is recommended for
graders to read through before giving our application a try.

## Attribution
You can find attribution for some of the open source licenses in ATTRIBUTION.md

## License
Currently, Sluggo's rights are reserved to the Sluggo team, and of course to the CSE 183 course staff for testing.
We are looking into various open source licenses, and will be sharing Sluggo as an open source project later.
