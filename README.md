A modern, simple issue tracker for teams. App for the py4web framework.

# Installation Instructions
Sluggo uses a mostly standard py4web environment as defined by the conda environment for py4web in CSE183, including
the packages added partway through the quarter (click & watchgod).
However, some additional prerequisites are required.

In addition to the standard environment, Sluggo relies on libraries specified in our requirements.txt file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You should then have all necessary prerequisites to run Sluggo.

## How to Use
